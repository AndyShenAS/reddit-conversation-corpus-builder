# reddit-conversation-corpus-builder
A collection of scripts to collect the comment forests of subreddits in a particular language and format them in a dialogue XML document specified by my professor.

Uses PRAW, an easy to use reddit-API wrapper which also handles reddit's API rules (such as <= 60 requests per minute)
